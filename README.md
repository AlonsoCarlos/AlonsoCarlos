### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**AlonsoCarlos/AlonsoCarlos** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the university 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming
- ðŸ‘¯ I currently have no idea who to collaborate
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about video games, music, sports, movies, or anything :)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Alonso or Carlos, both are fine
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to play some instruments, for example for example the guitar and the accordion
--> Hi! My name is Alonso Carlos, I am currently studying software engineering at university, I like to play video games, listen to music, go out with my friends, as well as programming, only that I am still a novice in this and I am learning, nice to meet you!
